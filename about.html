            <h3>Our <span class="special">Objective</span></h3>
            <p>Our goal for TherapAI is to provide a safe space
                online for war veterans with PTSD to seek support. 
                Frequently, people with PTSD tend to withdraw from 
                friends and family. TherapAI aims to avoid common
                concerns associated with visiting a human therapist, 
                such as confidentiality, judgement, and stress.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">The <span class="special">Technicals</span></h3>
            <p>
                TherapAI will be trained on a wide variety of data, consisting 
                of videos and pictures of different emotions. The AI will pick up on 
                slight differences in tone, facial cues, keywords, and body language
                to accurately access the patients current emotional state. 
                What counts as success for our AI? Our goal is for TherapAI to seem as
                human-like as possible, be able to accurately summarize sessions, and
                give diagonoses or suggestions supported by evidence.
